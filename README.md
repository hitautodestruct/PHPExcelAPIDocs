PHPExcelAPIDocs
===============

This repo was created after discovering that the PHPExcelA API could not be found online.
And also after [a chat](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18203595/how-do-i-get-a-range-of-cells-in-phpexcel/18203764#comment-26680685) with the creator of the library

All files including documentation can be found at the official [github repo](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel)
